# airline-reservation-system
Airline Reservation System‚Äù main aim is to provide the online ticket &amp; seat reservation of National and International Flights and also give us the information about flight departures.
In this JAVA Major project mainly we are going to concentrate on ticket booking function, this function will take the user inputs like their requirements (flight name, flight source & destination, Number of seats, Seat numbers), after entering all of his/her requirements in this application, it can check at backend & provide us the total information about flights. When we open the first page of this project we can find the basic information (basic fair & discounts) about today flight timings.

This Java project mainly contains 2 important modules like

Domestic Flights
International Flight
In national flights module the admin allows users to create their username and they can search their requirements of national flights, if any flight is available they can book the national flight tickets In International flights module the admin allows users to create their username and they can search their requirements of international flights, if any flight is available they can book the International flight tickets..

In this proposed system the administrator login and select the type of the flight like International or National then they enters the reservation details like source station to destination station. If the seats are available for that particular flight then this application gives the conformation to the user about the reservation ticket with printout.
